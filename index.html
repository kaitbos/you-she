    <h1>Love what you wear and find a place for what you don’t.</h1>

    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>You+She is an online market dedicated to buying, selling, discussion, and discovery of female-founded, romantic
      brands.
      We love all things of beauty and we care about the quality, sustainability and ethics of the brands. Over the
      years, we
      have been collecting the brands that are beautiful both inside and out. We highly recommend them to you and are
      providing our support via this secondhand market.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Kait and Yuxi (you-she) met on Instagram and bonded over our shared love of fashion. We have talked about
      clothing for
      years and discovered how transformative thoughtfully-crafted pieces have been in our lives. As mothers of young
      kids
      we’ve found fashion helpful in our personal journeys. From wearing a soft nightgown while up in the middle of the
      night
      to feeling like the Belle of the ball at an event in a romantic gown. Our clothing is an important part of our
      lifestyle.</p>
    <p>After selling our clothing in numerous ways online we decided to create a space dedicated to reselling beautiful
      brands
      to the stylish community that we love to be a part of. We hope to create a positive space where people can collect
      heirloom pieces, chat about clothing, and create friendships. We would love to
      share our
      passion by sharing reviews of our heirloom pieces and newly discovered jewels as post or story.</p>

    <h2>Buying Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Buying is simple and safe at You+She!! We require sellers to price based on the condition determined
      according to
      our standards and also disclose known flaws. All Paypal transactions are protected by utilizing the Goods & Services option.
      Have fun
      shopping!</p>

Types of photos:

We would love a close-up “swatch” pic of the fabric and pretty print that you’re listing! Let’s appreciate the details.
